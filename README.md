# Logo Parser & Simulator

This project parses, interprets, and runs Logo (called Hogo in this coursework) code. Read Report.pdf for a more detailed explanation of the project and how to run the program!

## Assessment 

**Final Mark:** 82 (before late penalty)

A more detailed breakdown of the marks and assessment is outlined in the Assignment_Feedback pdf file. I regret not organising and managing my Term 2 deadlines better, because I would have loved to do this coursework to a much better standard (and also submitted early to avoid the late penalty!) since it is genuinely one of the best courseworks I've been assigned. Not only do you get to play around with the more interesting parts of Haskell, you also get to write a parser, interpreter, and simulator of Logo code.  

If you are a 1st year Warwick CS student reading this: please start your Term 2 coursework early and avoid having to speedrun all of the assignments (to a poor standard) like I did. 

As with the first coursework: this coursework rewards being able to write an efficient and elegant solution, being able to explain your code (in the comments), and also going above and beyond. 

I would recommend going above and beyond especially in this coursework, as more interesting concepts are being explored than in the first; you will learn a LOT about Haskell (and get a good mark).
